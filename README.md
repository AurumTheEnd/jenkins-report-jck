# jenkins-report-jck
Jenkins plugin to show unit-test, tesng, jtreg and JCK reports summaries, diffs and details

The plugin reads archived gzipped xml files prdoduced by junit/testng/jtreg/jck suites  ([or anyhow else generated](https://github.com/judovana/OpenJdkBuilder/blob/master/tck/autoruns/jtreg-shell-xml.sh)) runs.

## Implementation details
The xml reports you recieve, should be post processed a bit, and compressed.  Compressed, as plugin is used with reports hundrets of megabytes large. And postprocessed as various engines generates various reports. Thus the xml files should be gathered into archives, which are later considered as suites. The level of granularity is up to you. The tar.gz archvies are later cached as two relatively small json files - one with listing for diff, one with stack traces of failures.  Latest cache is the properties file with total/run/passed/failed/error/skipp keys to be reused via https://github.com/judovana/jenkins-report-generic-chart-column (and used for quicker renderig of graphs of this plugin itself)
## Job run details
### run page
On a build page, simple ```JTREG Reports Total: X, Error: Y, Failed: Z``` message is printed, where **JTREG Reports** is link to  dretails page:
### details page
![details page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2904395/43016541-6cb4cc5c-8c53-11e8-944b-cf1d274c492e.png)
Here yo can see **table**, with suites. Each suite have detailed  total/passed/failed/error skip details.  Table is followed by **listing of faiures**. The listing is clear, and contains failed tests only. Each failure contains expandable **trace**. The listing is fllowd by **diff**. Diff is done first for added/removed suites. For unchanged suites, the diff of suite itself is done. You can immediately see exact **fixed** and **freshly failing** tests. After the diff, you can see full listing of testsuite. The ful listing is stipped to 1000 lines due to performance. The output is generated by the rutines of [Diff cli tool](#diff-cli-tool), so please apologise a bit of cryptic "passed or missing" and "faile dor error" output. To see the full listing, you must use the [cli](#diff-cli-tool).
